description: "Windyridge is a 1912 novel by English writer Willie Riley, the first\
  \ of his 39 published books. It sold half a million copies, stayed in print until\
  \ 1961, and was republished in 2010 with an extended introduction by David Copeland\
  \ (ISBN 978-1-906600-18-1).\nThe book was originally written as an entertainment\
  \ for Riley's wife and two recently bereaved friends, the Bolton sisters, to be\
  \ read to them in weekly episodes during 1911 and 1912.\nThe story concerns young\
  \ artist and photographer, Grace Holden, who moves from London to spend a year in\
  \ the small Yorkshire village of Windyridge.\nIn 1928 Riley wrote a sequel, Windyridge\
  \ Revisited, which remained in print until 1949.\nRiley's obituaries on his death\
  \ in 1961 described him as \"the famous Bradford-born author of Windyridge and 34\
  \ other novels\" and \"the author who established himself with his first novel,\
  \ Windyridge\".\nAfter moving to Silverdale in 1919, Riley renamed his house there\
  \ \"Windyridge\", a name it still retains. The name became fashionable as a house\
  \ name and was widely used.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
